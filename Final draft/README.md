## Description

This project aims to create a responsive website which collates excerpts from different pieces of classical literature from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. The authors of these extracts would all use the concept of a **mirror** as a literary device or piece of imagery, to build the atmospheres and landscapes of their works. This project focuses on the **mirror** as an object which has become central to our sense of perception and self-reflection, yet has been relatively overlooked in literary criticism. By creating a literary anthology, accessible online, this digital publication hopes to rekindle people's fascination with the **mirror** and open up intellectual discussion on the use of the **mirror** as a literary device.

The following steps needed to be taken to facilitate this project:

1. Research which pieces of classical literature and which authors are known to include the concept of the **mirror** in their works.
2. Search for extracts from these texts and authors which use the concept of the **mirror**, saving these extracts to plain text (.txt) files.
3. Create a website where operators can browse by category, view bibliographies relating to the **mirror**, and submit feedback forms.
4. Add responsive elements to create an aesthetic around the **mirror** theme; allow the site to be accessible via different viewports.

### Why 'Speculum | Speculorum'?

## Objectives

This project was undertaken whilst the author was learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the course on **Programming for the Internet**. Thus, the objectives of this project were set at a level that was conceived to be achievable in a matter of months, and on rudimentary knowledge of programming. The main objective of this project was, therefore, to practise and apply what had been learnt in these classes. The project would also be informed by the content of the **Digital Publishing** course, which gave a broad contextual overview of what is involved in digital publication.

As this project was of an experimental nature, the author chose to take a broad sweep of classical literature, using English language and translated texts (given that English is their maternal language), and mobilising texts available from [Project Gutenberg], which would naturally limit the collected extracts to more well-known or canonical authors.

### What were the central ideas of this project?

To use:

- ==CSS grid== within the website
- ==media queries== and ==CSS flexbox== to make the anthology accessible via different viewports
- JavaScript to ==embed== content (the extracts) within a page
- ==audio== clips within the website
- the ==:hover selector== to add responsivity to the site
- custom ==fonts== within the site
- the ==transform== and ==transition== attributes to add responsivity

To create:

- a drop down ==nav== bar
- a feedback ==form== where operators can submit reviews or suggestions to build the anthology
- a ==README file== to explain the project

### What were the criterion for the literary corpus?

Texts would be:

- in the **English** language, or would have been translated into English
- available via [Project Gutenberg]
- from witihin the accepted literary **canon** (as defined by those texts available on [Project Gutenberg])
- from between the **16<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries**, giving a broad overview of all periods
- *chosen based on their use of the central concept, aiming to reduce a dependency on clich√©*

## Future

This project can clearly be developed further, given more time, and has a lot of potential.

The author has defined several goals for the advancement of the project:

1. Create a **French and German version** of the site which hosts texts in their original languages
2. Expand the available **non-fiction works**, to capture a different audience
3. Include works from the **21<sup>th</sup> century**
4. Design own **illustrations** for use on the website, to replace current images
5. Improve accessibility, by adding more **viewport options**
6. Expand the extracts to include the use of the term **'looking-glass'** and the verb **'to mirror'**
7. Allow people to make **creative writing submissions** about the mirror for the 21<sup>th</sup> century section
8. Create an **opening transition**, effect or graphic, to build the aesthetic and ambience of site
9. Add a **search** component to the site
10. **Include more extracts for each section**
